# Thirty-Eight

Win the election!

Each square in a District is a side on a die. By campaigning around the country, you can increase your influence.

Keep an eye on the realtime horserace analysis!

After 20 rounds, all Districts will be rolled and whoever wins the most Districts wins!

## Actions

### Move ($10)

Move to a connected District and add an Influence to that District.

### Rally ($50)

Add two Influence to the District you're currently visiting.

### Fly ($500)

Move to any District and add an Influence to that District.

## Districts

There are three kinds of Districts: urban, suburban, rural. They are only different in how many votes each candidate starts with.

### Movement

This will all make more sense when I implement a real map.

You can only move from the CITY to the SUBURBS.

From the SUBURBS you can move to a few RURAL Districts and the CITY.

In the RURAL Districts, you can move to one of the SUBURBS and to neighboring RURAL Districts.
