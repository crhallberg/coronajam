> Some interactive experiments, slap-dashed together while day-drinking indoors.

## The Plan

**The Date:** IDK, this weekend? May 16th?
**The Place:** Our house or just outside of it.

Apply some slap-dashery to a few small ideas I have kicking around, maybe livestream it. I'm hoping to make just some kind of headway on:

- Thirty-Eight (political simulator)
- Hold Shift (aka. Last Cast, press your luck maze game)
- The Fed Idle Game (idle game with debt, what?)
- Legacy Money Card Game
- Sticker Dice
- Space Station Legacy Card Game

I'll be eating only a [complete protein](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/quinoa-and-broccoli-casserole-7288418) and drinking bad alcohol. Maybe if I can convince someone to playtest a game with me or [donate to charity](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/coronavirus-relief) or something, I'll upgrade to scotch and burgers.

## The Games

TBD
